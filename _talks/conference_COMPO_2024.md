## 🎤 Talk Overview
This **conference presentation** covered **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** techniques for modeling **electromagnetic near fields** in electronic boards and CubeSats. The discussion highlighted **surrogate modeling**, kernel selection, and correlation analysis for efficient EMC predictions.

### 🔹 **Key Topics**
✔ **Near-field measurement techniques** using **electric & magnetic probes**  
✔ **Infinitesimal Dipole Model (IDM)** for equivalent radiation modeling  
✔ **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** for field prediction and uncertainty estimation  
✔ **Surrogate modeling for CubeSat PCBs** to enhance EMC compliance testing  
✔ **Correlation matrix & variogram analysis** to optimize kernel selection  

### 🛠 **Methodology**
- **Measurements**: Near-field scans on PCBs using a **29x55 (1mm) & 35x35 (10mm) grid**
- **Modeling Approach**: **GPR with RBF kernels** & **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**
- **Key Findings**:
  - The **choice of kernel parameters** significantly impacts model accuracy.
  - Anisotropic correlation structures **must be accounted for** to improve predictions.
  - **Surrogate models** effectively estimate **EM field distributions** in complex DUTs.

### 📍 **Conference Details**
📅 **Date**: September 5, 2024  
📍 **Location**: Turin, Italy  
🏢 **Venue**: EMC Compo 2024
