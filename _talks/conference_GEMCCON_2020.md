## 🎤 Talk Overview
This **conference presentation** analyzed **Power over Ethernet (PoE) systems** using **modal analysis techniques** to evaluate **conducted emissions (CE)** and **circuit asymmetries**. The study focused on how design imperfections affect **signal integrity** and **electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)**.

### 🔹 **Key Topics**
✔ **PoE architecture & standardization** (IEEE 802.3at/af)  
✔ **Modal decomposition of multi-conductor transmission lines (MTL)**  
✔ **Impact of asymmetric DC/DC converters & balun center-tap imbalances**  
✔ **Conducted emissions (CE) & transmission path interference**  
✔ **Simulation & analytical models for EMC compliance**  

### 🛠 **Methodology**
- **Ideal vs. Non-Ideal Circuit Analysis**:
  - Theoretical modal decomposition to separate transmission modes
  - Modeling **asymmetric impedance effects** on circuit behavior
- **Parametric Sensitivity Analysis**:
  - **λ and δ** parameters used to model DC/DC converter and balun center-tap unbalance
  - Evaluated their impact on **noise coupling** and **transmission integrity**
- **Key Findings**:
  - **Balun transformer imbalances** introduce **mode coupling & high-frequency harmonics**
  - **PoE transmission paths remain robust** if the system is symmetric
  - **Internal common-mode noise is less critical** than signal mode interference
