  abstract = {This paper introduces a modeling method for deriving equivalent Infinitesimal Dipole Models (IDMs) of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) operating at multiple frequencies within a CubeSat environment. The IDMs are generated using a morphological image-processing technique, which is suitable for wideband simulation and compatible with full-wave solvers. The proposed approach is validated on two virtual PCB designs, with the IDMs constructed and simulated in a full-wave solver showing excellent agreement with the original boards. The models are then incorporated into a CubeSat-like environment to evaluate mutual coupling. Results demonstrate that IDMs can effectively predict coupling between boards in various environments, providing a robust tool for Electromagnetic Compatibility testing and design optimization.},

  abstract={Near-field modeling techniques have proven to be very useful for electromagnetic compatibility evaluation. In this article, a new method for building infinitesimal dipole models using near-field phaseless scans is presented. The proposed approach enables the identification of optimal dipole source locations by comparing the pattern of an infinitesimal dipole with the measured field maps. Finally, the dipole moments are fitted by using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. This method is validated on two different virtual devices and on measurements from a real device. These test cases cover a range of frequencies (156, 381, 514, and 1 GHz) and scan dimensions (9.4 cm × 8.4 cm and 10.6 cm × 14 cm), demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has emerged as a powerful technique for building surrogate models of electromagneticfield scans in electronic systems. However, standard GPR models often struggle to capture the non-isotropic and complex spatial patterns commonly found in electronic board field distributions. In this paper, we propose some inspection tools to analyze the underlying correlation structure in the measurement data. This analysis is demonstrated by considering as input data the near field emissions from a bent miscrostrip line (full-wave simulations) and a chip (near-field measurements).},

  abstract={This work uses the partial image expansion method to build an infinitesimal dipole model (IDM) of a physical Printed Circuit Board (PCB) starting from the measured near-fields. Using partial image expansion allows to include the substrate directly in the equivalent model, that is composed of PEC plane, substrate and dipole sources. The addition of the dielectric increases the model versatility allowing for a wider range of simulations to be run (e.g. closed environments, multiple boards, etc.). In this paper, the radiation model of the physical device is obtained and imported in a commercial full-wave solver (HFSS). The simulation results are finally compared with the original measurements, experimentally validating the accuracy of an IDM built using partial image expansion.},

Specifically, the proposed approach enables the construction of equivalent models that include dipole sources, substrate, and perfect electric conductor plane. The electromagnetic near-fields of the infinitesimal dipoles in this configuration are estimated through an adaptation of the partial image expansion technique. The proposed method has the capability to provide accurate results for a wide variety of configurations. Furthermore, it can be easily incorporated into existing dipole array optimization workflows with minimal added computational complexity.},

It is shown that in the ideal case in which all circuit components behave ideally, data and power propagate through different paths without interference. The obtained modal circuits are then used as starting point to investigate the detrimental effects on signal transmission introduced by possible imbalance (i.e., asymmetry with respect to ground) affecting the involved circuit components.},
