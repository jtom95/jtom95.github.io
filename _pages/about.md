Hi! I'm a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano, Italy. My work focuses on Machine Learning and Statistical approaches for optimization and Modeling of Physical Systems. In particular, I worked with the European Space Agency (ESA) to optimize the testing methods for CubeSats, by developing data-driven approaches based on simulating the electromagnetic conditions using simplified equivalent models.


My Work and Research
======

I specialize in **physical modeling, optimization, and AI-driven methods** applied to **electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), adaptive sampling, and satellite systems**. My work combines machine learning and statistical analysis with computational electromagnetics to enhance testing and modeling techniques for space applications.  

Currently, I am exploring **AI-driven optimization** for **satellite electronics testing** in collaboration with the **European Space Agency (ESA)** and **Politecnico di Milano**. I am also actively involved in **neural network applications for near-field electromagnetic fields, surrogate modeling, and coupling analysis between PCBs** using simplified models.

My Background
======
In 2020, I obtained a **double MSc. in Electrical Engineering** from **Politecnico di Milano & Torino**, awarded **cum laude**. I am an alumni of **Alta Scuola Politecnica**, a merit-based extra-curriculum program that explored technological innovation, their application to the market, entrepreneurship etc. 

Now I am finishing my **PhD in Electrical Engineering** from **Politecnico di Milano** in collaboration with **ESA**, where I developed **data-driven and simulation-based testing methods for CubeSats**. My academic journey includes:  
  
Throughout my career, I have had research experiences at **ESA, CERN, and TUHH**, where I worked on **adaptive sampling, surrogate modeling, and electromagnetic analysis**.  

Beyond my research, I am passionate about **Statistics, Machine Learning and open-source AI tools**. You can find my projects on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/jtom95) or connect with me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-monopoli-1b8600161).
