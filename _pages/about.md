_PhD in Electrical Engineering | AI & Electromagnetics | Space Systems_

My Work and Research
======

I specialize in **physical modeling, optimization, and AI-driven methods** applied to **electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), adaptive sampling, and satellite systems**. My work combines **deep learning, reinforcement learning, and statistical analysis** with **computational electromagnetics** to enhance testing and modeling techniques for space applications.  

Currently, I am exploring **AI-driven optimization** for **satellite electronics testing** in collaboration with the **European Space Agency (ESA)** and **Politecnico di Milano**. I am also actively involved in **neural network applications for near-field electromagnetic fields, surrogate modeling, and mutual coupling analysis using reaction theorem-based techniques**.

My Background
======
I hold a **PhD in Electrical Engineering** from **Politecnico di Milano** and **ESA**, where I developed **data-driven and simulation-based testing methods for CubeSats**. My academic journey includes:  
- A **double MSc. in Electrical Engineering** from **Politecnico di Milano & Torino**, awarded **cum laude**.  
- Participation in the **Alta Scuola Politecnica**, an elite honors program for top students from Italyâ€™s leading technical universities.  
- Research experiences at **ESA, CERN, and TUHH**, where I worked on **adaptive sampling, surrogate modeling, and neural networks for electromagnetic analysis**.  

Beyond my research, I am passionate about **machine learning, Statistics, and open-source AI tools**. You can find my projects on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/jtom95) or connect with me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-monopoli-1b8600161).
