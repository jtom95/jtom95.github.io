## Overview
As part of a **12-month entrepreneurship program**, I collaborated with a **multidisciplinary team** to develop a **smart-bin** that autonomously sorts waste into categories using **computer vision and deep learning**.

### 🔹 Features
✔ **AI-powered waste classification** using a fine-tuned **VGG16 CNN**  
✔ **Raspberry Pi integration** for real-time waste detection  
✔ **Camera module & sensors** for object recognition  
✔ **Step motor mechanism** for automatic waste sorting  

### 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, camera module, step motors, sensors  
- **Software:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Pre-trained **VGG16**, fine-tuned with a custom waste dataset  

### 📅 Project Timeline
**June 2018 - June 2019** | Part of the **[VENTO Startup & Entrepreneurship School Program](https://ogrtorino.it/updates/vento-il-primo-venture-builder-non-profit-per-creare-aziende-disruptive)**

### 🚀 Presentation & Recognition
The project was showcased at the **[OGR Torino Technology & Innovation Fair](https://ogrtorino.it/)**, where we presented the prototype to industry experts and investors.
