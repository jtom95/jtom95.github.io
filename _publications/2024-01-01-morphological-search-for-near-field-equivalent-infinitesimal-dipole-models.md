abstract: 'Near-field modeling techniques have proven to be very useful for electromagnetic compatibility evaluation. In this article, a new method for building infinitesimal dipole models using near-field phaseless scans is presented. The proposed approach enables the identification of optimal dipole source locations by comparing the pattern of an infinitesimal dipole with the measured field maps. Finally, the dipole moments are fitted by using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. This method is validated on two different virtual devices and on measurements from a real device. These test cases cover a range of frequencies (156, 381, 514, and 1 GHz) and scan dimensions (9.4 cm × 8.4 cm and 10.6 cm × 14 cm), demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the proposed method.'
