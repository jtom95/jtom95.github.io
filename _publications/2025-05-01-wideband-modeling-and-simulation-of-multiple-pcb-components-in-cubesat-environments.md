abstract: 'This paper introduces a modeling method for deriving equivalent Infinitesimal Dipole Models (IDMs) of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) operating at multiple frequencies within a CubeSat environment. The IDMs are generated using a morphological image-processing technique, which is suitable for wideband simulation and compatible with full-wave solvers. The proposed approach is validated on two virtual PCB designs, with the IDMs constructed and simulated in a full-wave solver showing excellent agreement with the original boards. The models are then incorporated into a CubeSat-like environment to evaluate mutual coupling. Results demonstrate that IDMs can effectively predict coupling between boards in various environments, providing a robust tool for Electromagnetic Compatibility testing and design optimization.'
