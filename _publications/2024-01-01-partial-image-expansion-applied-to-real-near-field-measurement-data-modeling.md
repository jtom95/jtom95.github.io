abstract: 'This work uses the partial image expansion method to build an infinitesimal dipole model (IDM) of a physical Printed Circuit Board (PCB) starting from the measured near-fields. Using partial image expansion allows to include the substrate directly in the equivalent model, that is composed of PEC plane, substrate and dipole sources. The addition of the dielectric increases the model versatility allowing for a wider range of simulations to be run (e.g. closed environments, multiple boards, etc.). In this paper, the radiation model of the physical device is obtained and imported in a commercial full-wave solver (HFSS). The simulation results are finally compared with the original measurements, experimentally validating the accuracy of an IDM built using partial image expansion.'
